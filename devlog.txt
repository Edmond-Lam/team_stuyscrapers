Constantine Athanitis - 4/3/17 2:10 AM

Research the different map that can be created for the US. I have several examples that should work fine for our project...unfortunately however, nothing will disply unless running on a web server, so the flask app must be up and running first.


Constantine Athanitis - 4/3/17 2:45 PM and 5:00 PM

Successfully created and displayed a map of the US. Also created the dropdown menu for the different views. Started working with code to display points.


Maddie Ostergaard - 4/4/17 2:45 PM
