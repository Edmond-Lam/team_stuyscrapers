Research the different map that can be created for the US. I have several examples that should work fine for our project...unfortunately however, nothing will disply unless running on a web server, so the flask app must be up and running first.

Successfully created and displayed a map of the US. Also created the dropdown menu for the different views. Started working with code to display points.
