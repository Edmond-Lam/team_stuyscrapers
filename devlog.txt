Constantine Athanitis - 4/3/17 2:10 AM

Research the different map that can be created for the US. I have several examples that should work fine for our project...unfortunately however, nothing will disply unless running on a web server, so the flask app must be up and running first.


Constantine Athanitis - 4/3/17 2:45 PM and 5:00 PM

Successfully created and displayed a map of the US. Also created the dropdown menu for the different views. Started working with code to display points.

Constantine Athanitis - 4/4/17 2:45 PM and 5:00 PM

Completed code that allows random sample points/circles to be displayed on the map


Constantine Athanitis - 4/4/17 10:57 PM

Finished creating a basic legend that changes output indicators as user changed the map view.


Constantine Athanitis - 4/5/17 12:23 AM

Finished fully-functional color legend


Issac Kim - 4/5/17 12:32 AM

Finish function to convert lat and long to x and y.

Constantine Athanitis - 4/5/17 2:55 AM

Finished creating another dropdown menu for different year options (as a replacement for the slider). Finished inputting sample data set and year parsing function.


Constantine Athanitis - 4/5/17 4:33 AM

Final attempt at everything. Was able to use Issac's parser code to plot the points...but the projection scaling is still off. Also, I implemented the height coloring. I added more input options in the year dropdown menu. Also enhanced the changeYear function. NOTE: This is the best I could come up with given having to start from scratch within six hours. Some team members were more helpful than others...
